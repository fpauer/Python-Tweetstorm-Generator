#What is a Tweetstorm ?

It's a way to bypass Twitter's blessed 140 chars limit.
It allows you to  break down a larger corpus of text into tweets and post them in quick succession, forming a cohesive whole.
Since Twitter can barely count (and  monotonically increasing numbers is hard!), the final order in which users will see the sequence might not be the one you posted. Or someone retweeted it, loosing context. See the matching example.jpg for an actual Tweetstorm.

In order to keep some sense of narrative and connection you prefix each piece of the corpus with the part that it represents (1/4, then 2/4 then 3/4 then 4/4).
